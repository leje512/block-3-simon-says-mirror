Simon Says is a game for two players. 
One of the players gives a command, the other has to follow it, but only when the player 'Simon Says' said.
First, you have to join into the same room. After you are in the same room, you can press the start button. 
Player one has to choose one of the four commands 'left hand up', 'right hand up', 'both hands up' or 'both hands down'.
To choose one of the commands, the player has to click on the button above the arm of the little robot in the left-down corner of the canvas. 
If the player wants to say 'Simon Says' then he should press on the speech bubble. 
Now the player sends this to player two. On the Table of player two is a robot that moves its arms if player one sends the command. 
When player one chose 'Simon Says', a LED in the robot's head should light up. That means player two has to follow the command and put the arms the same way as the robot. 
If the LED stays off, player two has to let his arms down.
If player two did everything right, nothing happens, now he can choose a command for player one, but if there was something wrong, he loses a life.
This game lasts until one of the players has no life anymore.
